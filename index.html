        <h1 class="n1">1. Is India odd man out in China-dominated SCO and BRICS?</h1>

        <p>With the rise of China as a global economic and military super-power inevitable this decade, India will be the odd man out in the SCO and the BRICS as virtually all the members of these groupings are recipients of copious infrastructure aid from Beijing in the name of Belt-Road Initiative (BRI). Brazil is still to join the BRI but has already received some USD 66 billion in infrastructure investment from China with its Leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cozying up to President Xi Jinping in Beijing last month.</p>

The SCO summit is being hosted by India and the BRICS summit by Brazil in 2023.</p>
